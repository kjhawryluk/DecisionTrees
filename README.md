# DecisionTrees
This project was for my Machine Learning class. It creates a decision tree from scratch and cross validates the results using Python with NumPy.  At the end, it produces a graph of the validation curve to show how the decision tree depth improved/affected the accuracy on the training and test set. The code looks the included data set on arrhythmia.
